# Stage 5 Test Results - Label Management System

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Stage**: 5 - Label Management System  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## Overview
Stage 5 introduces a comprehensive label management system that allows users to create, edit, and delete custom labels with colors. Labels can be assigned to tasks for better organization.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Label Manager Component (`LabelManager.tsx`)
- **Full CRUD operations** for labels (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- **Color picker** with 8 predefined colors + custom color input
- **Live preview** of label appearance before saving
- **Inline editing** - click edit button to modify existing labels
- **Delete confirmation** - prevents accidental deletions
- **Responsive modal design** - works on all screen sizes
- **Loading states** and error handling

### 2. Dashboard Integration (`dashboard/page.tsx`)
- **"Manage Labels" button** added to dashboard header
- Opens the Label Manager modal
- **Auto-refresh** - tasks and labels update after any label operation
- Seamless integration with existing task management

### 3. Backend Integration
- Connected to existing label API endpoints (`/api/labels`)
- Cascade delete on backend ensures deleted labels are removed from all tasks
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
