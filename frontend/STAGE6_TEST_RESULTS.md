# Stage 6 Test Results - Advanced Filtering, Sorting & Polish

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Stage**: 6 - Advanced Filtering, Sorting & Polish  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Testing

---

## Overview
Stage 6 completes the frontend with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities, allowing users to efficiently manage and organize their tasks. This is the final stage of the frontend development.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Task Filters Panel Component (`TaskFiltersPanel.tsx`)
- **Expandable/Collapsible Panel** - Saves screen space when not needed
- **Active Filter Indicator** - Shows when filters are applied
- **Task Count Display** - Shows "X of Y tasks" based on active filters
- **Reset All Button** - Quickly clear all filters and sorting

### 2. Filtering Options
- **By Priority**: Filter tasks by High, Medium, or Low priority
- **By Status**: Show All, Completed only, or Incomplete only
- **By Overdue**: All tasks, Overdue only, or Not overdue
- **By Labels**: Multi-select label filtering (shows tasks with ANY selected label)

### 3. Sorting Options
- **Sort By**: Created date, Deadline, or Priority
- **Sort Order**: Ascending or Descending
- **Smart Sorting**: Tasks without deadlines go to the end when sorting by deadline

### 4. Dashboard Integration
- Filters panel integrated above task list
- Real-time filtering with `useMemo` for performance
- Maintains filter state while performing CRUD operations
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### 5. UX Enhancements
- **Predefined color swatches** for label selection
- **Visual feedback** for selected filters (ring effect on labels)
- **Clear communication** of active filters
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Priority Filtering
**Steps**:
1. Create tasks with different priorities (High, Medium, Low)
2. Open the Filters & Sort panel
3. Select "High" from the Priority dropdown
4. Verify only high-priority tasks are displayed

**Expected Result**:
- Only tasks with High priority are shown
- Task count updates correctly (e.g., "Showing 3 of 10 tasks")
- "Active" badge appears on the filters panel

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 2: Completion Status Filtering
**Steps**:
1. Mark some tasks as completed
2. In filters, select "Completed" from Status dropdown
3. Verify only completed tasks show
4. Switch to "Incomplete" and verify

**Expected Result**:
- Completed filter shows only checked tasks
- Incomplete filter shows only unchecked tasks
- All filter shows both types

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 3: Overdue Filtering
**Steps**:
1. Create tasks with various deadlines (past, today, future)
2. Select "Overdue Only" from Due Date dropdown
3. Verify only overdue incomplete tasks appear

**Expected Result**:
- Only tasks with past deadlines (and not completed) are shown
- Completed tasks are never shown as overdue
- Tasks without deadlines are excluded

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 4: Label Filtering (Multi-Select)
**Steps**:
1. Create several labels (e.g., Work, Personal, Urgent)
2. Assign labels to various tasks
3. In filters panel, click multiple label chips
4. Verify tasks with ANY of the selected labels appear

**Expected Result**:
- Clicking a label adds it to the filter (shows ring)
- Tasks matching any selected label are shown
- Clicking again removes the label from filter
- "Showing tasks with any of the selected labels" message appears

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 5: Sorting by Created Date
**Steps**:
1. Create several tasks at different times
2. Set Sort By to "Date Created"
3. Toggle between Ascending and Descending
4. Verify task order changes correctly

**Expected Result**:
- Descending shows newest tasks first
- Ascending shows oldest tasks first
- Task order updates immediately

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 6: Sorting by Deadline
**Steps**:
1. Create tasks with various deadlines
2. Include some tasks without deadlines
3. Sort by "Deadline" in both directions

**Expected Result**:
- Ascending: earliest deadline first, no-deadline tasks at end
- Descending: latest deadline first, no-deadline tasks at end
- Tasks without deadlines always appear last

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 7: Sorting by Priority
**Steps**:
1. Create tasks with all priority levels
2. Sort by "Priority"
3. Toggle Ascending/Descending

**Expected Result**:
- Descending: High → Medium → Low
- Ascending: Low → Medium → High
- Consistent ordering

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 8: Combined Filters
**Steps**:
1. Apply multiple filters simultaneously:
   - Priority: High
   - Status: Incomplete
   - Labels: Work, Urgent
   - Sort by: Deadline (Ascending)
2. Verify all filters work together

**Expected Result**:
- Only high-priority, incomplete tasks with Work OR Urgent labels appear
- Tasks are sorted by deadline (earliest first)
- Task count reflects combined filters

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 9: Reset All Filters
**Steps**:
1. Apply multiple filters (priority, labels, status)
2. Click "Reset All" button
3. Verify all filters clear

**Expected Result**:
- All filters return to default values
- All tasks are displayed again
- "Active" badge disappears
- Task count shows total tasks

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 10: Filter Persistence During CRUD
**Steps**:
1. Apply some filters (e.g., Priority: High)
2. Edit a task (change priority from High to Low)
3. Verify the task disappears from filtered view
4. Create a new High priority task
5. Verify it appears in the filtered view

**Expected Result**:
- Filters remain active during task operations
- Task list updates correctly based on active filters
- No filter state is lost

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

---

### Test 11: Expandable Panel Functionality

   - Mobile (<768px)
2. Verify all filters are accessible and functional

**Expected Result**:
- Filters stack appropriately on smaller screens
- Dropdown menus work on touch devices
- Label chips wrap nicely
- No horizontal scrolling required

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

2. Verify appropriate messaging

**Expected Result**:
- "No tasks found" message appears
- Task count shows "Showing 0 of X tasks"
- Filters can be adjusted or reset
- No errors occur

**Status**: ⏳ Pending

## Performance Considerations

### useMemo Optimization
- Filtering and sorting use `useMemo` to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- Only recomputes when `tasks` or `filters` change
- Smooth performance even with many tasks

### Filter Logic
- All filters work together (AND logic for filter types, OR for labels)
- Efficient array methods (filter, some, sort)
- No duplicate API calls

---

## Accessibility & UX Polish

### Keyboard Navigation
- All controls accessible via keyboard
- Tab order is logical
- Enter/Space to toggle selections

### Visual Feedback
- Hover states on all interactive elements
- Clear active states for selected filters
- Loading states during data fetch
- Error messages are user-friendly

### Color & Contrast
- Label colors are customizable by user
- Text maintains readability on all backgrounds
- Focus indicators are visible

## Known Issues
None at this time. All features implemented according to specifications.
