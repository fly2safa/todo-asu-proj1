## Manual Testing Checklist

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Backend running at http://localhost:8000
- ✅ User already registered and logged in
- ✅ Frontend running at http://localhost:3000

### Test 1: Dashboard Access (Authenticated) ✅ (To be tested)
1. Log in to the application
2. Should redirect to /dashboard
3. Should see Header with username
4. Should see "My Tasks" heading
5. Dashboard should load without 404

**Expected**: Dashboard displays successfully (no more 404!)

### Test 2: Dashboard Access (Unauthenticated) ✅ (To be tested)
1. Clear cookies or use incognito window
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
3. Should redirect to /login

**Expected**: Cannot access dashboard without authentication

### Test 3: Header Display ✅ (To be tested)
1. On dashboard, check the header
2. Should see TODO app icon and title
3. Should see your username
4. Should see Logout button

**Expected**: All header elements display correctly

### Test 4: Logout Functionality ✅ (To be tested)
1. Click the "Logout" button in header
2. Should redirect to /login
3. Try accessing /dashboard again
4. Should redirect back to /login

**Expected**: Logout clears session and prevents dashboard access

### Test 5: Empty Task List ✅ (To be tested)
1. If you have no tasks in backend:
2. Should see empty state with checkmark icon
3. Message: "No tasks found"
4. Subtext: "Get started by creating your first task!"

**Expected**: Friendly empty state displays

### Test 6: Task Display ✅ (To be tested)

**Create test tasks via backend/Swagger UI first:**

Using http://localhost:8000/docs, create a few tasks with:
- Different priorities (High, Medium, Low)
- Different deadlines (past, today, future)
- Some completed, some incomplete
- Optional: Add labels

Then on dashboard:
1. All tasks should display in TaskCard format
2. Priority badges should show correct colors
3. Completed tasks should have strikethrough + checkmark
4. Overdue tasks should have red "Overdue" indicator
5. Deadlines should be formatted (e.g., "Oct 10, 2025")
6. Labels should display with custom colors

**Expected**: All task information displays correctly

### Test 7: Loading State ✅ (To be tested)
1. Refresh the dashboard page
2. Should briefly see loading spinner
3. Then tasks should appear

**Expected**: Smooth loading transition

### Test 8: Error Handling ✅ (To be tested)
1. Stop the backend server
2. Refresh dashboard
3. Should see error message in red alert box
4. Message should say "Failed to load data"

**Expected**: Graceful error handling with clear message

## What's Still Missing (By Design)

Since this is Stage 3 (Read-Only Display), the following are **intentionally not included**:
- ❌ Create new task button (Stage 4)
- ❌ Edit task functionality (Stage 4)
- ❌ Delete task functionality (Stage 4)
- ❌ Toggle task completion (Stage 4)
- ❌ Label management (Stage 5)
- ❌ Filtering and sorting (Stage 6)

These will be added in later stages!

## Next Stage

**Stage 4: Task Management (CRUD Operations)**

Ready to proceed with:
- TaskFormModal for creating/editing tasks
- Edit and delete buttons on TaskCard
- Task completion toggle (checkbox)
- "New Task" button
- Full CRUD functionality
- Auto-refresh after mutations

---
