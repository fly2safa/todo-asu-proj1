# Frontend Development Stages

This document outlines the staged development approach for the TODO application frontend.

## Overview

The frontend will be built in 6 incremental stages, with each stage adding specific functionality and being committed to git upon completion. This approach mirrors the backend development methodology.

---

## Stage 1: Project Setup and Configuration ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Initialize Next.js project with all necessary dependencies and basic configuration.

### Tasks:
- [x] Initialize Next.js 14 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- [x] Install required dependencies (axios, react-hook-form, lucide-react, js-cookie, date-fns)
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS with custom styles and component classes
- [x] Set up project structure (lib, types, components, contexts)
- [x] Create TypeScript types for all API entities (User, Task, Label)
- [x] Set up API client with Axios and interceptors
- [x] Create service modules (auth, tasks, labels)
- [x] Configure environment variables

### Deliverables:
- `package.json` with all dependencies
- `tailwind.config.ts` with custom configuration
- `globals.css` with utility classes
- `types/index.ts` with all TypeScript interfaces
- `lib/api.ts` with axios configuration and interceptors
- `lib/auth.ts`, `lib/tasks.ts`, `lib/labels.ts` service modules
- `.env.example` with required variables

### Testing:
- Run `npm run dev` to verify the project builds successfully
- Check that all dependencies are installed without errors

## Stage 2: Authentication UI (Login & Register)

**Goal**: Build complete authentication flow with login and registration pages.

### Tasks:

- Verify redirect to dashboard after successful login

### Commit Message:
```
feat: implement authentication UI (Stage 2)

- Add AuthContext for user state management
- Create login and register pages with form validation
- Implement cookie-based token storage
- Add authentication redirects
```
