## üé¨ Screen Recording Strategy

### Recommended Approach

**Option A: Single Continuous Recording** (30 min)
- Pro: Shows real-time flow
- Pro: Authentic demonstration
- Con: One mistake requires re-recording
- **Recommended for**: Experienced presenters

**Option B: Multiple Short Recordings** (5-10 clips)
- Pro: Can redo sections if needed
- Pro: Edit out mistakes
- Con: Requires video editing
- **Recommended for**: First-time presenters

**Option C: Two-Part Recording** (Part 1: Features, Part 2: Technical)
- Pro: Logical split
- Pro: Can focus on each aspect
- Con: Requires joining videos
- **Recommended for**: Detailed demonstrations

### Our Recommendation for You
‚Üí **Option A** (Single recording) using **TESTING_CHEATSHEET.md**

Why?
- Your project is fully functional
- Cheatsheet provides clear flow
- More impressive to show live
- Less editing work
