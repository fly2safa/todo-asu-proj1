# Rubric Improvements Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Project**: Full-Stack TODO Application  
**Purpose**: Ensure full rubric compliance for maximum score

## üéØ Changes Made to Achieve Full Score

### 1. ‚úÖ Predefined Labels for New Users (REQUIRED - 10 points)

  - Added import for `LabelModel` (line 11)
  - Added predefined labels creation after user registration (lines 65-81)
  - Labels created: Work (Blue), Personal (Green), Urgent (Red), Shopping (Amber), Health (Pink)

**Impact**: 
- ‚úÖ Satisfies rubric requirement for predefined labels
- ‚úÖ Improves user onboarding experience (users can start organizing tasks immediately)
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes (existing users unaffected)
